    <h1>Briards</h1>
    <p class="credits">by Ivy Duckett</p>
    <p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
     Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is
        a large breed of dog traditionally used as
        a herder and guardian of sheep...</p>
    <h2>Characteristic</h2>
    <p>The coat is long (no less than 7 cm), thick and harsh like that of a goat; it may be solid black, grey, blue or
        fawn, or fawn overlaid with black; greying is seen to a variable extent. Dogs stand 62-68 cm at the withers,
        bitches about 56-64 cm. An unusual characteristic of the breed is the double dewclaw on the hind legs; the
        breed standard specifies a single or absent dewclaw as a disqualifying fault</p>
