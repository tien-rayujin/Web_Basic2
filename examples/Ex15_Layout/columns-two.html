    <h1>The Evolution of bicycle</h1>
    <div class="column1of2">
        <p>The first verifiable claim for a practically used bicycle belongs to German Baron Karl von Drais, a civil
            servant
            to the Grand Duke of Baden in Germany. Drais invented his Laufmaschine (German for "running machine") in
            1817,
            that was called Draisine (English) or draisienne (French) by the press. Karl von Drais patented this design
            in
            1818, which was the first commercially successful two-wheeled, steerable, human-propelled machine, commonly
            called a velocipede, and nicknamed hobby-horse or dandy horse. It was initially manufactured in Germany and
            France.</p>

        <p class="example">The intervening decades of the 1820s-1850s witnessed many developments concerning
            human-powered
            vehicles often
            using technologies similar to the draisine, even if the idea of a workable two-wheel design, requiring the
            rider
            to balance, had been dismissed. These new machines had three wheels (tricycles) or four (quadracycles) and
            came
            in a very wide variety of designs, using pedals, treadles, and hand-cranks, but these designs often suffered
            from high weight and high rolling resistance. However, Willard Sawyer in Dover successfully manufactured a
            range
            of treadle-operated 4-wheel vehicles and exported them worldwide in the 1850s.</p>

        <p>The high-bicycle was the logical extension of the boneshaker, the front wheel enlarging to enable higher
            speeds
            (limited by the inside leg measurement of the rider), the rear wheel shrinking and the frame
            being made lighter. Frenchman Eug√®ne Meyer is now regarded as the father of the high bicycle by the ICHC in
            place of James Starley. Meyer invented the wire-spoke tension wheel in 1869 and produced a classic high
            bicycle
            design until the 1880s.</p>
