    <h1>The Evolution of bicycle</h1>
    <blockquote>"Life is like riding a bicycle.
        To keep your balance you must keep moving." - 
        Albert Einstein</blockquote>
    <p>The first verifiable claim for a practically used bicycle belongs to German Baron Karl von Drais, a civil servant
        to the Grand Duke of Baden in Germany. Drais invented his Laufmaschine (German for "running machine") in 1817,
        that was called Draisine (English) or draisienne (French) by the press. Karl von Drais patented this design in
        1818, which was the first commercially successful two-wheeled, steerable, human-propelled machine, commonly
        called a velocipede, and nicknamed hobby-horse or dandy horse. It was initially manufactured in Germany and
        France.</p>

    <p class="example">The intervening decades of the 1820s-1850s witnessed many developments concerning human-powered
        vehicles often
        using technologies similar to the draisine, even if the idea of a workable two-wheel design, requiring the rider
        to balance, had been dismissed. These new machines had three wheels (tricycles) or four (quadracycles) and came
        in a very wide variety of designs, using pedals, treadles, and hand-cranks, but these designs often suffered
        from high weight and high rolling resistance. However, Willard Sawyer in Dover successfully manufactured a range
        of treadle-operated 4-wheel vehicles and exported them worldwide in the 1850s.</p>

    <p>The high-bicycle was the logical extension of the boneshaker, the front wheel enlarging to enable higher speeds
        (limited by the inside leg measurement of the rider), the rear wheel shrinking and the frame
        being made lighter. Frenchman Eug√®ne Meyer is now regarded as the father of the high bicycle by the ICHC in
        place of James Starley. Meyer invented the wire-spoke tension wheel in 1869 and produced a classic high bicycle
        design until the 1880s.</p>
